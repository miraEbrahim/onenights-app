every component that is interested in using Firebase has access to the Firebase instance with a FirebaseContext.Consumer component. Even though you will see it first-hand later for this application, the following code snippet shows how it would work:

import React from 'react';

import  { FirebaseContext } from '../Firebase';

const SomeComponent = () => (
  <FirebaseContext.Consumer>
    {firebase => {
      return <div>I've access to Firebase and render something.</div>;
    }}
  </FirebaseContext.Consumer>
);

export default SomeComponent;
